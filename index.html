<div data-id="1" class="aos-item" data-aos="fadeInUp"><h2 class="work">fast facts</h2>
    
<p> Overdose is the leading cause of death for Americans under 55, above car crashes and gun violence. Overdoses have increased in all drug categories, male and female, all ethnicities, all areas of urbanization, aged 15+. In 2017, 72,000 people died from a drug overdose.
 <br><br>
4/5 heroin users reported beginning to use heroin after becoming addicted to opioid painkillers. From 1999 to 2011 hydrocodone consumption more than doubled, and oxycodone consumption increased by nearly 500%. During that time frame, opioid-related OD death rate nearly quadrupled.

    All opioids connect to particular brain and nervous system receptors that exist for the body's natural painkiller, endorphins. Although opium had been used in various forms for thousands of years, morphine was the first pure medication derived from the poppy plant. In medicine and law enforcement, relative strength is compared to morphine.

    The following opioids contribute to the overdose epidemic, and their relative strengths in comparison to morphine are listed.
