   </h1>
        
        <p class="intro"> Friends and family of drug users as well as the users themselves need to be well versed on the ways they can help or even potentially save the drug user in their life. Even if you don’t personally know a drug user, the rate of overdose is increasing so quickly that it is likely to encounter someone in need of this type of help in your lifetime. Here are some ways to help someone struggling with drug addiction or general usage.</p></div>

            <h2 class="worko">effective <br> treatment</h2>
        
<p class="eff"> Based on scientific research since the mid-1970s, the following key principles should 
form the basis of any effective treatment program: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Addiction is a complex but treatable disease that affects brain function and behavior.</li>
<li>No single treatment is right for everyone.</li>
<li>People need to have quick access to treatment.</li>
<li>Effective treatment addresses all of the patient’s needs, not just his or her drug use.</li>
<li>Staying in treatment long enough is critical.</li>
<li>Counseling and other behavioral therapies are the most commonly used forms of 
treatment.</li>
<li>Medications are often an important part of treatment, especially when combined 
with behavioral therapies.</li>
<li>Treatment plans must be reviewed often and modified to fit the patient’s changing needs.</li>
<li>Treatment should address other possible mental disorders.</li>
<li>Medically assisted detoxification is only the first stage of treatment.</li>
<li>Treatment doesn't need to be voluntary to be effective.</li>
<li>Drug use during treatment must be monitored continuously.</li>
<li>Treatment programs should test patients for HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B and C, 
tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases as well as teach them about steps 
    they can take to reduce their risk of these illnesses.</li></ul></div>

   <h2 class="work">naloxone</h2> 
   <p>WHAT IS IT?
       <br>
Naloxone counteracts the life-threatening effects of an opioid overdose. Since most accidental overdoses occur in a home setting, it was developed for first responders, as well as family, friends, and caregivers—with no medical training required.
Naloxone is not a substitute for emergency medical care. Always get help immediately, even if the person wakes up, because he/she may relapse into respiratory depression. The use of Naloxone may result in symptoms of acute opioid withdrawal. Results may vary.
       <br><br>
WHERE CAN I FIND IT?
       <br>
If there are prescription opioids in your home, then Naloxone should be there too.
       Anyone can purchase Naloxone in the form of NARCAN® Nasal Spray directly from a pharmacist without a doctor’s prescription. All major pharmacy chains (such as CVS, Walgreen's, and RiteAid) stock NARCAN®, so it’s convenient for you to obtain today. Although it is a prescription medication, all states have passed laws to increase access of naloxone in the community and in homes where there are opioids present. In every state, residents can purchase NARCAN® directly from a pharmacist under a Statewide Naloxone Standing Order or Collaborative Practice Agreement.</p></div>
